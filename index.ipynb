Therefore we are comfortable moving M a large amount without fear that we will 'overstep' and pass the optimal M which minimizes the cost function. The closer we get to the bottom of the cost function, the less steep our gradient from the differentiation will be, and so the smaller we move M to minimise the cost function - as we are worried we may end up overstepping the optimal M, which  minimizes the cost function."

    "7 is most likely the optimal polynomial feature degree, although an argument could be made for 3 depending on the context, and output of the different models. This is because at 3 the root mean sqared error for the features is the lowest than any point on the test data, however it may reduce the overal predictive ability of the model. This means that the model will have low bias, but could have high variance as it (due to this predictive limitation by a low number of features). After 7, the root mean squared error rises significantly. This means that adding these further features increases the variance massively for the test data. However it is fitting the training data fine at this point - in fact, this is the lowest training error on the graph. Past 7 means that the model is heavily biased towards the training data, and the variacance for the test data increases dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is overfitting, and means that our model is very good at fitting our test data(high bias), but poor at being generalised to outside data. There is a balance between the bias and variance that is usually aimed for in models, so we can train them to be appropriate for the data we are feeding in, but used to predict accurately(with low error) external, unseen data.

    "If our model is underfitting our data, we can add more features to increase its predictive quality, or perform gradient descent to find a better coefficient weighting to minimise the cost function. We can also add in interaction terms, by multiplying the effect of seperate data points together do find a new data point which may increase the predictive quality of our model better. For example, when predicting the income of people, Educational Years, and Age may both help to predict income, however education years * Age may add a term which increases the Rsquared of a model too. They are also likely related in some way (though this depends on the demographic of the population). At its heart, this adds another feature which can help predict our target variable.\n",

The fact that these are so unrelatable means that if they are fed into a regularization model without scaling, the regressions will immediatly weight towards the features which have the highest actual values (1000 grams) but drop ones with small values (1 Kg) even though they could be the same, or potentially even a better predictor (e.g $1). \n",
